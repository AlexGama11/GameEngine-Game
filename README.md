## My Game Engine!

Making a Game Engine for class, gonna make a Sword-Forging game with it!

In order to use the code, delete the sln folder and click on generate.bat to make your solution. It is set to vs2022, change the value according to your needs.

[Itch](https://alexmango.itch.io/sdl-sword-forger) page for the Project.

## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That's this file you're reading.

← `Main.cpp`: This is the main file with the main menu.

← `Generate.bat`: A batch file my friend [BetterDrgn](https://github.com/BttrDrgn) taught me to make, it allows you generate your own solution to avoid issues.

← `Premake.lua`: Lua script to generate the solution.

← `Premake.exe`: Exe file the lua script uses to generate the solution.

## What levels or features are in the game currently?

← `Main Menu`: Will be animated in the future, currently leads to two Menus, Options and UBW.

← `UBW`: Will be the menu where the game happens in the future, for now you just have a character that can move there.

← `Options`: Currently used to change Sound Volume, may add future options in the future, such as screen brightness, game speed, controls, or player name.
