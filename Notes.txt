Some C++ commands to remind myself of.



//	gets mouse coords
		auto mousePosition = Input::Instance()->GetMousePosition();

	    std::cout << "Mouse Position: " << mousePosition.x << ", " << mousePosition.y << std::endl;

		/*gets mouse movement*/
		auto mouseMotion = Input::Instance()->GetMouseMotion();

	    std::cout << "Mouse Motion: " << mouseMotion.x << ", " << mouseMotion.y << std::endl;

	//	gets mouse wheel movement
		auto mouseWheel = Input::Instance()->GetMouseWheel();

		std::cout << "Mouse Wheel: " << mouseWheel << std::endl;

		//checks if space is clicked
		if (Input::Instance()->IsKeyPressed(HM_KEY_SPACE) == true)
		{
			std::cout << "Spacebar" << std::endl;
		}

		//prints the key thats pressed. Works good with printable keys only.
		std::cout << Input::Instance()->GetKey() << std::endl;

		//checks if left mouse is clicked
		if (Input::Instance()->IsMouseClicked(HM_MOUSE_LEFT) == true)
		{
			std::cout << "Left Mouse Click" << std::endl;
		}
